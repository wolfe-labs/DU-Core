# Wolfe Labs Core Utilities for Dual Universe

This library is mostly core stuff used by multiple projects from Wolfe Labs, including libraries such as [Screenmancy](https://github.com/wolfe-labs/Screenmancy) and is not meant to be directly compiled.

To use it, you might need the [DU-LuaC compiler](https://github.com/wolfe-labs/DU-LuaC) utility.

## Features

- Class and OOP utilities such as inheritance
- Event handling and triggering with syntax similar to jQuery
- Table utilities
- Debugging utilities
- Improved `Utils.print` function with line-break support
- WIP `SharedMemory` class to share information across script instancies, but **VERY BUGGY, DO NOT RELY**
